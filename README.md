The objective of the project was to analyze HR data to identify trends and insights regarding employee retention. The project aimed to develop a deep understanding of attrition rates, salary distributions, employee satisfaction, and other factors influencing retention within a company.

The analysis yielded several important insights:

1. Attrition Hotspots: Departments like sales and research exhibited higher-than-average attrition rates, indicating possible issues related to job satisfaction or work pressure.
2. Salary Influence: A clear relationship was established between lower monthly income and higher attrition rates, suggesting that employees with lower pay were more likely to leave the organization.
3. Work-Life Balance: Certain job roles, such as research scientists, reported lower satisfaction with work-life balance, which may contribute to attrition in these roles.
4. Promotion Delays: Employees who had not received a promotion in over five years were more likely to leave the company, highlighting the importance of career progression in retention strategies.


The Employee Retention Project successfully identified critical factors affecting employee retention through the application of data analytics. By leveraging Excel, MySQL, Power BI, and Tableau, I was able to gain insights into how various aspects of job satisfaction, salary, and promotion opportunities impact an employee's decision to stay or leave a company.The project highlighted the importance of data-driven decisions in HR management and provided valuable experience in using modern analytical tools to solve real-world business problems. The KPIs developed during the project can serve as a foundation for further analysis and improvement of retention strategies within organizations.
